Overview: These are assets for a website created for Euphyllia Life, a website I was hired to develop as an outlet for blog posts and selling aquarium products. During the project, I created branding for the company, customized the "Minimal" Shopify theme with added SCSS/HTML to provide a better overall experience, and designed the layout/structure of the website. In addition, I provided both a Style Guide for branding purposes, and a User Guide so that adding articles/products, making any edits, and changing anything on the website would be straight forward.

Tech Used:
- Shopify
- HTML5
- SCSS

Project Requirements:
- Layout and style needed to be clear, simple, and concise.
- The website needed to include collections of Blog Posts and Products.
- The owner would need to be able to easily add new posts, products, and pages.

Deliverables:
- A fully functional Shopify website that houses both a blog, and an online shop.
- A text-based logo for the Euphyllia Life brand.
- A Style Guide showing all colors and fonts used, for use in future branding.
- A User Guide that can be used as a reference for anyone making edits to the website.
